## Main Carousel Image

Please place your main carousel image (the beautiful image of children with peace signs) in this directory with the filename:

**Filename:** `carousel-main.jpg`

This image will be displayed as the **first image** in the automatic carousel on the home page.

### Image Requirements:
- Recommended format: JPG or PNG
- Recommended size: 800x600 pixels or larger (will be automatically resized)
- The image will be displayed with rounded corners and proper aspect ratio

If the image is not found, the carousel will automatically fall back to a default image.
